## Building an API

What I have learned

1 - Write nodejs code as fast as possible with Express Framework

2 - Different types of API, Why and How to use Restful API Design, plus: API testing with Postman app

3 - Perform CRUD operations with express

4 - Deal with routes (Single and Multiple routers simultenously)

5 - Deal with middlewares (Write own, use 3rd parts)

6 - MVC Architecture (separation of concern)

7 - Serving static files direct on url

8 - What, why and how to deal with environment variables, and MORE

This code demonstrate all these concepts and...

Note: app1.js app2.js and app3.js are only for for grasping purposes, and these files can be skipped out
      and the code will still consistent.
      
### Enjoy!
